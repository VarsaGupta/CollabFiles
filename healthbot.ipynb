However, the exact nature of these genetic differences is not detailed in the provided context.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the classification of depression has evolved over time, and the terminology and diagnostic criteria may have changed since the time of these publications.

              "\"Bipolar disorder and unipolar depression, also known as major depressive disorder, are both mood disorders, but they have distinct characteristics:\\n\\n1. Mood Episodes:\\n   - Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating episodes of mania or hypomania (a less severe form of mania) and depression. During manic episodes, individuals may experience elevated mood, increased energy, reduced need for sleep, grandiosity, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, and impulsive or risky behavior. Hypomanic episodes have similar but milder symptoms.\\n   - Unipolar depression involves only depressive episodes without the manic or hypomanic episodes seen in bipolar disorder. Symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide.\\n\\n2. Treatment:\\n   - Bipolar disorder often requires a combination of mood stabilizers (like lithium or anticonvulsants), antipsychotics, and sometimes antidepressants. It is crucial to manage both the depressive and manic phases.\\n   - Unipolar depression is typically treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. In some cases, other treatments like electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used.\\n\\n3. Course of Illness:\\n   - Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition with recurrent episodes of mania and depression. The pattern and frequency of episodes can vary widely among individuals.\\n   - Unipolar depression can also be a chronic condition with episodes that come and go, but it does not include the manic or hypomanic episodes that define bipolar disorder.\\n\\n4. Diagnosis:\\n   - The diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be more complex due to the need to identify a history of manic or hypomanic episodes in addition to depressive episodes.\\n   - Unipolar depression is diagnosed based on the presence of depressive episodes without a history of mania or hypomania.\\n\\nUnderstanding the differences between these two disorders is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. It's important to note that while the above points outline general differences, individual experiences can vary, and a thorough evaluation by a mental health professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis.\""

The impact of the PPD is major on the maternal bond and the \\nhealth of both mother and child. Its physiopathological mechanisms appear to \\ndiffer from other types of depression. Today, pharmacotherapy is based on \\nnonspecific treatment, and recent therapeutic advances in this field require a \\ncomprehensive approach of the implication of the GABAergic system in the \\ndevelopment of PPD. Neurosteroid levels during pregnancy and after parturition \\nand the GABA-A-r modulation are thought to be involved in PPD.\\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the GABAergic approach is relevant in postpartum \\ndepression management.\\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature based on the MEDLINE \\ndatabase with the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): \"postpartum \\ndepression\", \"GABA\", \"ganaxolone\", \"brexanolone\", \"allopregnanolone\", prior to', 'database with the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): \"postpartum \\ndepression\", \"GABA\", \"ganaxolone\", \"brexanolone\", \"allopregnanolone\", prior to \\nSeptember 2019.

This plasticity in the peripartum period maintains levels of \\ninhibition adapted despite increased neurosteroid levels. KO models for the \\nGABA-A-r δ subunit develop depression and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum \\nperiod, and a change in the expression of the gene coding for the GABA-R alpha-4 \\nsubunit was found.

A synthetic \\nneurosteroid (SGE-516) was tested on mouse models of PPD, KO for δ-GABA-A-r or \\nKCC2, and showed decreased depressive symptoms and better mothering. Clinical \\nstudies confirm neurosteroid fluctuation and changes in the GABAergic system \\nduring the peripartum period. Allopregnanolone is the neurosteroid the most \\nstudied in PPD, and it is elevated in the brain during the pregnancy. Studies \\ndisagree on the presence of significant differences in allopregnanolone plasma \\nlevels during pregnancy or postpartum between women with PPD or not. Women with \\na history of PPD have greater susceptibility to neurosteroid withdrawal. Imagery \\nand genetical data also show a link between allopregnanolone and PPD.

However, there must be main pivots for diverse \\ntypes of depression. From recent therapeutic observations, both the serotonin \\n(5-HT) and kynurenine pathways of tryptophan metabolism may be of particular \\nimportance to improved understanding of depression. Here, I propose an \\netiological classification of depression, based on key peripheral and central \\nenzymes of tryptophan metabolism.\\nDISCUSSION: Endogenous depression is caused by a larger genetic component than \\nreactive depression. Besides enterochromaffin and mast cells, tryptophan \\nhydroxylase 1 (TPH1), primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, is also \\nfound in 5-hydroxytryptophan-producing cells (5-HTP cells) in normal intestinal \\nenterocytes, which are thought to essentially shunt 5-HT production in \\n5-HT-producing cells. Genetic studies have reported an association between TPH1', 'enterocytes, which are thought to essentially shunt 5-HT production in \\n5-HT-producing cells. Genetic studies have reported an association between TPH1 \\nand depression, or the responsiveness of depression to antidepressive \\nmedication. Therefore, it is possible that hypofunctional 5-HTP cells \\n(reflecting TPH1 dysfunction) in the periphery lead to deficient brain 5-HT \\nlevels. Additionally,it has been reported that higher TPH2 expression in \\ndepressed suicides may reflect a homeostatic response to deficient 5-HT levels. \\nSubsequently, endogenous depression may be caused by TPH1 dysfunction combined \\nwith compensatory TPH2 activation. Reactive depression results from life \\nstresses and involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with resulting \\ncortisol production inducing tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) activation. In \\nsecondary depression, caused by inflammation, infection, or oxidative stress, \\nindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is activated. In both reactive and secondary', 'secondary depression, caused by inflammation, infection, or oxidative stress, \\nindoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is activated. In both reactive and secondary \\ndepression, the balance between 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and kynurenic acid \\nmay shift towards 3-HK production via kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) \\nactivation. By shifting the equilibrium position of key enzymes of tryptophan \\nmetabolism, the classical classification of depression can be reorganized, as \\nbelow. Peripheral classification of depression by key enzymes: TPH1 dysfunction, \\nTDO activation, IDO activation. Central classification: TPH2 activation, KMO \\nactivation.\\nSUMMARY: Etiological classification of depression expressed by peripheral (TPH1, \\nTDO, IDO) and central (TPH2, KMO)enzymes of tryptophan metabolism may enable \\ndepression to be viewed as a clear box, with the inner components available for \\ninspection and treatment.', 'DOI: 10.1186/s12888-014-0372-y\\nPMCID: PMC4321701\\nPMID: 25540092 [Indexed for MEDLINE]']\n"

He was treated for \\nseveral weeks with high-dose SNP, due to severe pulmonary hypertension and an \\nextremely labile haemodynamic profile. He progressively developed high \\nthiocyanate levels and, concomitantly, free calcium ion depletion, despite \\nnormal total calcium levels, with iterative ventricular arrhythmias.

We suspected a \\ncausative role of thiocyanate since the negatively charged sulfur atom of the \\nthiocyanate molecules could bind the positively charged free calcium ions, \\nleading to a free calcium ion depletion. Thus, we cautiously reduced SNP dosage, \\naccording to the patient's haemodynamic profile, with concomitant progressive \\nfree calcium ion normalization, thus reducing the arrhythmic burden of the \\npatient, being able to finally perform heart transplantation.\\nCONCLUSION: We describe for the first time a proarrhythmic side effect of \\nprolonged SNP administration, namely, calcium ion depletion, likely related to \\nthiocyanate toxicity.

We infected Nur77 mice \\nwith lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-Armstrong) to generate a robust \\nmemory compartment, where quiescent LCMV-specific memory CD8+ T cells could be \\nreadily tracked with MHC tetramer staining.

In \\nunivariate analysis, CPK elevation was significantly associated with age at \\ntransplantation, length of follow-up, treatment with everolimus, and idiopathic \\ncardiomyopathy as primary cardiac disease. In multivariate analysis, idiopathic \\ncardiomyopathy and length of follow-up were the only significant predictors of \\nCPK elevation (p\\xa0=\\xa00.002 and p\\xa0=\\xa00.0001, respectively). A subgroup of 19 \\npatients had frequent CPK elevation (>20% of the dosages). All these patients \\nbut 1 had an idiopathic cardiomyopathy as primary disease. In 5 of these 19', 'patients had frequent CPK elevation (>20% of the dosages). All these patients \\nbut 1 had an idiopathic cardiomyopathy as primary disease. In 5 of these 19 \\npatients, we identified a syndrome known to affect both cardiac and skeletal \\nmuscles. In conclusion, underlying idiopathic cardiomyopathy is a major \\ndeterminant of plasma CPK elevation after heart transplantation. Our results \\nshow that besides well-described syndromes associating skeletal and cardiac \\nmuscle disease, idiopathic cardiomyopathy may be associated with subclinical \\nskeletal muscle myopathy.', 'Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

However, I can provide a general overview of the steps involved in a heart transplant based on standard medical knowledge:\\n\\n1. **Donor Identification and Organ Matching**: A suitable donor heart must be identified. This involves matching blood type, body size, and ensuring the donor heart is healthy. The donor is typically a deceased person who has agreed to organ donation or whose family has consented.\\n\\n2. **Recipient Preparation**: The recipient is prepared for surgery, which includes a thorough medical evaluation to ensure they are a suitable candidate for transplant. This may involve various tests and assessments to evaluate the health of other organs and the presence of antibodies that might reject the transplant.\\n\\n3. **Organ Harvesting**: Once a donor is identified and the recipient is ready, the donor's heart is harvested. This is done with great care to preserve the organ's viability.\\n\\n4. **Recipient Surgery**: The recipient undergoes surgery where the diseased heart is removed. This is done by making an incision in the chest and connecting the patient to a heart-lung bypass machine, which takes over the function of the heart and lungs during the procedure.\\n\\n5. **Implantation**: The donor heart is then implanted. Surgeons connect the major blood vessels (the aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior vena cava) and ensure that there are no leaks at the connection sites.\\n\\n6. **Restarting the Heart**: Once the new heart is in place, it is restarted. This can be done by an electrical shock or may happen spontaneously once blood flow is restored.\\n\\n7. **Closure**: After the heart is beating steadily and the surgeons are satisfied with the function, the chest is closed, and the patient is taken off the bypass machine.\\n\\n8. **Postoperative Care**: The patient is closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for signs of rejection, infection, and organ function. Immunosuppressive medications are administered to prevent rejection.\\n\\n9. **Rehabilitation**: After initial recovery, the patient will undergo rehabilitation to regain strength and adjust to life with a new heart.\\n\\n10. **Long-term Follow-up**: Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the function of the transplanted heart and adjust medications as needed.\\n\\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the process, and actual procedures may vary based on the patient's condition, the transplant center's protocols, and advancements in medical technology and techniques.\""
