Mood Episodes:\\n   - Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating episodes of depression and mania or hypomania. Mania is a state of elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, and other symptoms such as inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, and impulsive behavior. Hypomania is a milder form of mania.\\n   - Unipolar depression involves only depressive episodes without the manic or hypomanic episodes that characterize bipolar disorder.\\n\\n2. Clinical Course:\\n   - Bipolar disorder typically involves recurrent episodes of mood disturbance ranging from extreme highs (mania) to extreme lows (depression).\\n   - Unipolar depression is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression without the mood elevation that bipolar disorder includes.\\n\\n3. Treatment:\\n   - Bipolar disorder often requires a combination of mood stabilizers (like lithium or valproate), antipsychotics, and sometimes antidepressants to manage both the depressive and manic phases.\\n   - Unipolar depression is usually treated with antidepressants, psychotherapy, or a combination of both. Care must be taken when treating bipolar depression with antidepressants, as they can trigger manic episodes.\\n\\n4. Etiology:\\n   - Both disorders can have genetic and environmental factors, but bipolar disorder is more strongly associated with a family history of mood disorders, suggesting a stronger genetic component.\\n   - Unipolar depression can also have a genetic component, but environmental factors such as stress and life events are significant contributors.\\n\\n5. Onset:\\n   - Bipolar disorder often starts in the late teens or early adulthood, but it can also begin in childhood or later in life.\\n   - Unipolar depression can begin at any age, but its onset is often in the mid-20s.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these are general distinctions and individual experiences can vary. Proper diagnosis by a mental health professional is crucial for effective treatment, as the management strategies for bipolar disorder and unipolar depression differ significantly.\""

The characteristics and challenges associated with TRD include:\\n\\n1. **Characteristics of TRD:**\\n   - **Lack of Response:** Patients with TRD do not experience a significant improvement in depressive symptoms after treatment with multiple antidepressants, typically of different classes, at adequate doses and durations.\\n   - **Chronicity:** Depression may become chronic, with symptoms persisting for months or even years.\\n   - **Severity:** Symptoms can be severe and include persistent sadness, hopelessness, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), changes in appetite and sleep, fatigue, and cognitive impairments.\\n   - **Functional Impairment:** TRD often leads to significant impairments in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning.\\n   - **Comorbidities:** Patients with TRD often have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorders, personality disorders, or substance use disorders, as well as medical comorbidities that can complicate treatment.\\n\\n2. **Challenges Associated with TRD:**\\n   - **Diagnosis:** Determining whether depression is truly treatment-resistant can be challenging. It requires a thorough assessment of treatment history, including medication adherence, dosage, duration, and the use of evidence-based psychotherapies.\\n   - **Treatment Options:** Limited treatment options are available once standard antidepressants fail. Options may include combination therapy, augmentation strategies, switching antidepressants, or considering non-pharmacological treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or ketamine infusions.\\n   - **Side Effects:** Patients with TRD may experience side effects from multiple medications, which can reduce their quality of life and complicate adherence to treatment.\\n   - **Psychosocial Impact:** The persistent nature of TRD can lead to despair and hopelessness, which can exacerbate symptoms and make patients less likely to adhere to treatment or seek help.\\n   - **Economic Burden:** TRD can be associated with increased healthcare utilization, higher medical costs, and lost productivity due to disability or decreased work performance.\\n   - **Research Gaps:** There is still much to learn about the pathophysiology of TRD and the best approaches to treatment. Research is ongoing to identify biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.\\n\\nManaging TRD often requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach that includes medical evaluation, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, lifestyle changes, and possibly alternative treatment modalities. It is important for healthcare providers to work closely with patients to develop a personalized treatment plan and to provide support throughout the treatment process.'"

        "\"\"Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD) is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD) characterized by the lack of response to standard treatments for depression. Patients with TRD have typically failed to respond to at least two different antidepressants given at an adequate dose and duration during the current episode of depression. The characteristics and implications of TRD include:\\n\\n1. **Persistent Symptoms**: Despite treatment, symptoms such as persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal thoughts may continue.\\n\\n2. **Increased Health Burden**: TRD is associated with a higher burden of disease, as measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost, indicating a significant impact on quality of life and functioning.\\n\\n3. **Economic Impact**: There are both direct and indirect costs associated with TRD. Direct costs include healthcare expenses such as doctor visits, hospitalizations, and medications. Indirect costs stem from reduced productivity, absenteeism, and potential unemployment due to the debilitating nature of the depression.\\n\\n4. **Treatment Challenges**: TRD often requires more complex treatment strategies. These may include combinations of medications, augmentation with other drugs such as atypical antipsychotics, and non-pharmacological interventions like psychotherapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\\n\\n5. **Innovative Treatments**: Due to the limitations of current options, there is interest in novel treatments, including the use of psychedelics like psilocybin, which have shown promise in recent research for their potential to improve symptoms in TRD.\\n\\n6. **Comorbidities**: Patients with TRD may have higher rates of comorbid psychiatric and medical disorders, which can complicate treatment and prognosis.\\n\\n7. **Suicide Risk**: Major Depression with Suicide Risk (MDSR) is a related concern, as individuals with TRD may be at an increased risk for suicidal ideation and attempts due to the severity and chronicity of their symptoms.\\n\\n8. **Quality of Life**: The persistent and refractory nature of TRD can lead to significant impairments in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning, severely affecting the quality of life of patients and their families.\\n\\n9. **Need for Reassessment**: It is crucial to reassess the diagnosis and treatment plan of patients with suspected TRD to ensure that other potential causes of treatment failure, such as incorrect diagnosis, suboptimal medication dosing, or patient non-adherence, are addressed.\\n\\n10. **Stigma and Perception**: Cultural perceptions of depression, including TRD, can vary widely, which may affect how patients perceive their illness and seek treatment. For instance, in some cultures, there may be a distinction between 'modern-type' depression, which is often associated with stress and lifestyle, and melancholic depression, which is more traditionally recognized and may carry different stigmas or treatment approaches.\\n\\nOverall, TRD is a complex and challenging condition that requires a multifaceted and often individualized treatment approach. It has significant implications for patients, healthcare systems, and society due to its chronic nature, treatment difficulties, and associated costs.\"\""

        "    AIMessage(content=\"Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that manifests in a variety of symptoms and can be categorized into different types or subtypes. Historically, these subtypes were officially recognized in diagnostic manuals like the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), but the most recent edition, DSM-5, no longer uses these subtypes because they were not found to be clinically useful. However, for historical and educational purposes, the previously recognized subtypes included:\\n\\n1. Paranoid Schizophrenia: Characterized by prominent delusions and auditory hallucinations while the affect (emotional response) remains relatively intact.\\n\\n2. Disorganized Schizophrenia (Hebephrenic Schizophrenia): Marked by disorganized speech, behavior, and flat or inappropriate affect.\\n\\n3. Catatonic Schizophrenia: Defined by a range of motor dysfunctions, from a complete lack of movement (catatonia) to excessive motor activity or peculiar movements.\\n\\n4. Undifferentiated Schizophrenia: When a person exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia that do not clearly fit into the paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic subtypes.\\n\\n5. Residual Schizophrenia: Where the patient has a history of at least one episode of schizophrenia, but the current symptoms are not prominent, although they might still display milder or less frequent symptoms such as odd beliefs or unusual perceptual experiences.\\n\\nIn contemporary practice, these subtypes are not used, and schizophrenia is considered a spectrum disorder with symptoms that can vary greatly from one individual to another. The symptoms are typically divided into three broad categories:\\n\\n- Positive symptoms: These include hallucinations, delusions, and thought disorders.\\n- Negative symptoms: These refer to a reduction or absence of normal behaviors and include flat affect, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), and social withdrawal.\\n- Cognitive symptoms: These involve problems with attention, memory, and executive functions.\\n\\nThe concept of schizophrenia is continually evolving with ongoing research. Some studies, like the ones referenced in the context provided, investigate specific aspects of schizophrenia, such as the persistence of symptoms or the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia patients.\")\n",

In response to microenvironment \\nalterations, SMCs dedifferentiate from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype \\ncharacterized by an increased proliferation, migration, production of ECM \\n(extracellular matrix) components, and decreased expression of SMC-specific \\ncontractile markers. These phenotypic changes result in vascular remodeling and \\ncontribute to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, including coronary \\nartery disease, stroke, hypertension, and aortic aneurysms. Here, we aim to \\nidentify the genetic variants that regulate ECM secretion in SMCs and predict \\nthe causal proteins associated with vascular disease-related loci identified in \\ngenome-wide association studies.\\nMETHODS: Using human aortic SMCs from 123 multiancestry healthy heart transplant', 'the causal proteins associated with vascular disease-related loci identified in \\ngenome-wide association studies.\\nMETHODS: Using human aortic SMCs from 123 multiancestry healthy heart transplant \\ndonors, we collected the serum-free media in which the cells were cultured for \\n24 hours and conducted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based \\nproteomic analysis of the conditioned media.\\nRESULTS: We measured the abundance of 270 ECM and related proteins. Next, we \\nperformed protein quantitative trait locus mapping and identified 20 loci \\nassociated with secreted protein abundance in SMCs. We functionally annotated \\nthese loci using a colocalization approach. This approach prioritized the \\ngenetic variant rs6739323-A at the 2p22.3 locus, which is associated with lower \\nexpression of LTBP1 (latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1) \\nin SMCs and atherosclerosis-prone areas of the aorta, and increased risk for SMC', 'expression of LTBP1 (latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1) \\nin SMCs and atherosclerosis-prone areas of the aorta, and increased risk for SMC \\ncalcification. We found that LTBP1 expression is abundant in SMCs, and its \\nexpression at mRNA and protein levels was reduced in unstable and advanced \\natherosclerotic plaque lesions.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results unravel the SMC proteome signature associated with \\nvascular disorders, which may help identify potential therapeutic targets to \\naccelerate the pathway to translation.', 'DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.123.320274\\nPMID: 38328934\\n\\n\\n4.

The derivation cohort consisted of \\n90 patients [age 68 ±8 years; LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 35% interquartile', 'evaluated and validated in a second cohort. The derivation cohort consisted of \\n90 patients [age 68 ±8 years; LV ejection fraction (LVEF) 35% interquartile \\nrange (IQR) (24-40)] and validation cohort of 60 patients [age 67 ± 9, LVEF 39% \\nIQR (29-45)]. In the derivation cohort, during a median follow-up of 45 months \\n[IQR (34-83)], 36 (43%) patients died and 23 (26%) had HFO. Patients with HFO \\nhad lower awUV [4.51 IQR (3.69-5.31) vs. 7.03 IQR (6.08-9.2), P < 0.001]. A \\nreduction in awUV [optimal awUV (5.58) cut-off determined by receiver operating \\ncharacteristics analysis] was a strong predictor of HFO (3-year HFO survival 97% \\nvs. 57%). The cut-off value was confirmed in the validation cohort (2-year \\nHFO-free survival 96% vs. 60%).\\nCONCLUSION: The newly proposed parameter awUV, easily available from routine \\nvoltage mapping, may be useful at identifying ICM patients at high risk for HFO.', '© The Author(s) 2024.

We suspected a \\ncausative role of thiocyanate since the negatively charged sulfur atom of the \\nthiocyanate molecules could bind the positively charged free calcium ions, \\nleading to a free calcium ion depletion.

We infected Nur77 mice \\nwith lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV-Armstrong) to generate a robust \\nmemory compartment, where quiescent LCMV-specific memory CD8+ T cells could be \\nreadily tracked with MHC tetramer staining.

However, I can provide a general overview of the steps involved in a heart transplant based on standard medical knowledge:\\n\\n1. **Donor Identification and Organ Matching**: A suitable donor heart must be identified. This involves matching blood type, body size, and ensuring the donor heart is healthy. The donor is typically a deceased person who has agreed to organ donation or whose family has consented.\\n\\n2. **Recipient Preparation**: The recipient is prepared for surgery, which includes a thorough medical evaluation to ensure they are a suitable candidate for transplant. This may involve various tests and assessments to evaluate the health of other organs and the presence of antibodies that might reject the transplant.\\n\\n3. **Organ Harvesting**: Once a donor is identified and the recipient is ready, the donor's heart is harvested. This is done with great care to preserve the organ's viability.\\n\\n4. **Recipient Surgery**: The recipient undergoes surgery where the diseased heart is removed. This is done by making an incision in the chest and connecting the patient to a heart-lung bypass machine, which takes over the function of the heart and lungs during the procedure.\\n\\n5. **Implantation**: The donor heart is then implanted. Surgeons connect the major blood vessels (the aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior vena cava) and ensure that there are no leaks at the connection sites.\\n\\n6. **Restarting the Heart**: Once the new heart is in place, it is restarted. This can be done by an electrical shock or may happen spontaneously once blood flow is restored.\\n\\n7. **Closure**: After the heart is beating steadily and the surgeons are satisfied with the function, the chest is closed, and the patient is taken off the bypass machine.\\n\\n8. **Postoperative Care**: The patient is closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for signs of rejection, infection, and organ function. Immunosuppressive medications are administered to prevent rejection.\\n\\n9. **Rehabilitation**: After initial recovery, the patient will undergo rehabilitation to regain strength and adjust to life with a new heart.\\n\\n10. **Long-term Follow-up**: Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the function of the transplanted heart and adjust medications as needed.\\n\\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the process, and actual procedures may vary based on the patient's condition, the transplant center's protocols, and advancements in medical technology and techniques.\""

        "\"I don't have access to the full text of the articles provided, which means I cannot give you a detailed step-by-step process of performing a heart transplant as outlined in those specific articles. However, I can provide a general overview of the steps involved in a heart transplant based on standard medical knowledge:\\n\\n1. **Donor Identification and Organ Matching**: A suitable donor heart must be identified. This involves matching blood type, body size, and ensuring the donor heart is healthy. The donor is typically a deceased person who has agreed to organ donation or whose family has consented.\\n\\n2. **Recipient Preparation**: The recipient is prepared for surgery, which includes a thorough medical evaluation to ensure they are a suitable candidate for transplant. This may involve various tests and assessments to evaluate the health of other organs and the presence of antibodies that might reject the transplant.\\n\\n3. **Organ Harvesting**: Once a donor is identified and the recipient is ready, the donor's heart is harvested. This is done with great care to preserve the organ's viability.\\n\\n4. **Recipient Surgery**: The recipient undergoes surgery where the diseased heart is removed. This is done by making an incision in the chest and connecting the patient to a heart-lung bypass machine, which takes over the function of the heart and lungs during the procedure.\\n\\n5. **Implantation**: The donor heart is then implanted. Surgeons connect the major blood vessels (the aorta, pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior vena cava) and ensure that there are no leaks at the connection sites.\\n\\n6. **Restarting the Heart**: Once the new heart is in place, it is restarted. This can be done by an electrical shock or may happen spontaneously once blood flow is restored.\\n\\n7. **Closure**: After the heart is beating steadily and the surgeons are satisfied with the function, the chest is closed, and the patient is taken off the bypass machine.\\n\\n8. **Postoperative Care**: The patient is closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) for signs of rejection, infection, and organ function. Immunosuppressive medications are administered to prevent rejection.\\n\\n9. **Rehabilitation**: After initial recovery, the patient will undergo rehabilitation to regain strength and adjust to life with a new heart.\\n\\n10. **Long-term Follow-up**: Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor the function of the transplanted heart and adjust medications as needed.\\n\\nPlease note that this is a simplified version of the process, and actual procedures may vary based on the patient's condition, the transplant center's protocols, and advancements in medical technology and techniques.\""
